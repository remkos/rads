Modules
-------

Modules are treated differently between compilers

gfortran:
- Needs -I flag for search.
- When a module is "use"d in another module it becomes part of the new module.
  Hence only the encapsulating module needs to be "use"d in another program,
  and only the encapsulating module needs to be made available.
  This behaviour is thus different from include files in both C and Fortran.

ifort:
- Needs -I flag for search. -module is available but has slightly different
  meaning. Avoid using -module.
- When a module is "use"d in another module it does not become part of the new module.
  This is simlar to include files in both C and Fortran.
  While only the encapsulating module needs to be "use"d in another program,
  all the modules needs to be made available.


Warning flags
-------------

gfortran:
- -Wall -Wtabs -fimplicit-none
  The -Wtabs is needed to *avoid* warning about tabs

ifort:
- -warn -nogen-interfaces
  The -warn is the same as "-warn all". This will also generate modules for
  traditional Fortran 77 files, which is probablematic as we use sometimes
  call routines with deviating arguments (integer*4 and integer*1 for example)
  Hence to avoid errors and warning, we need -nogen-interfaces


Free-form and extended source
-----------------------------

gfortran:
- *.f90 is automatically free-form.
  Add -ffixed-line-length-132 for 132 character in fixed form (*.f).
  Because ifort and others have only up the 132 characters, we need to set
  this limit.
  It is not needed for free-form files.

ifort:
- *.f90 is automatically free-form. Add -extend-source for 132 character
  lines in fixed-form (only).
  It is not needed for free-form files.
 
Optimisation
------------

gfortran:
- Add -O2 flag. Is default in autoconf.

ifort:
- Standard optimisation is -O2. Flag not needed. Is not added by autoconf.

Fortran specifics
-----------------
gfortran:
- Allowed "procedure" instead of "module procedure". Needed to fix that for ifort.

ifort:
- Requires to define some intrinsic functions like time()
