Hello everybody,

Since 11 April ERS-1 is in the 168-day repeat. During this Geodetic Phase,
ERS-1 will make 2411 orbital revolutions in EXACTLY 168 days. (This EXACTLY
comes from the fact that ERS-1 is in a sunsynchronous orbit).
The current planning for the geodetic phase is:

10 april - 23 may : first partial cycle in the geodetic phase
23 may - 7 november : first complete cycle of geodetic phase

After this there is a recommendation to continue the geodetic phase until
the ERS-1/2 tandem mission, which will commense after the ERS-2
commissioning phase (dec 94/jan 95 till mar/apr 95).

I have made some updates of the arc-by-arc fits for the groundtrack
program.  This includes new JGM-2 orbits and reprocessed old arcs with
JGM-2 gravity field. Note: the complete multi-disciplinary phase is now
reprocessed with the JGM-2 gravity field.

I have derived from this the following (mean) elements:

 a = semimajor axis
 e = eccentricity
 i = inclination
 w = argument of the perigee
 og = Omega - theta_g = longitude of the node with respect to Greenwich
 ogdot = d(og)/dt = node rate with respect to Greenwich
 wm = w + M = mean longitude
 wmdot = d(wm)/dt = angular motion

The reason for computing (og) instead of Omega is the fact that one might
have different definitions of theta_g, or at least different estimates.
Using (og) by-passes this problem. Not that (og) is about -360 deg/day,
as the orbit precesses to the West wrt to the rotating Earth and is
sun-synchronous. By the way, the value for (og) at midnight directly
relates to the LST of the node.
You can use these to have a idea of the groundtrack. For instance any
10 arcs of the 35-day repeat build a complete ground-track pattern. Likewise
any single arc from the 3-day repeat contains more than ones the entire
pattern.

The mean elements for the different phases of ERS-1 are (approximately !):

The attached file contains some software to generate a groundtrack
for any satellite, given a number of orbital elements.
Included you will find:

- groundtrack.f	: the source of the main program (manual inside)
- elemplot.f    : something I used to produce elemplot.ps
- elemplot.ps   : a nice plot with the elements for arc # 009-263
- *.f           : some supporting routines (manual inside)
- makefile      : the makefile (type 'make' to generate 'groundtrack')
- elem.???      : the mean elements for each arc

First save this file somewhere, e.g. as groundtrack.uue, preferably in
a new directory. You may like to clip off the head, but this is not necessary.
Then type

  uudecode groundtrack.uue

and you'll get a file groundtrack.tar.Z
Then unpack this by executing

  zcat groundtrack.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

Create 'groundtrack' with the makefile, so just type

  make

To run the groundtrack program for arc 200 type

  groundtrack < elem.200

You make like to create some long-period mean elements from the elem.???
files in the same format and run it through 'groundtrack'.
The elem.??? files have an extra line containing the maximum and
RMS position error of the fitted secular orbit's groundtrack position
and the orginal groundtrack position. The RMS error is usually of the order
1-2 km (700 m for the JGM-2 orbits).

Have a nice try with the software.

Remko.
