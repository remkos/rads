   The ocean tide model available at this site, called GOT00.2, is
the latest solution in a series beginning with the work described in:

E J O Schrama and R Ray, Journal of Geophysical Research, v.99, p 24799, 1994.

Its immediate predecessor (GOT99.2) is desribed in:

R Ray, A global ocean tide model from Topex/Poseidon altimetry: GOT99.2,
   NASA Tech Memo 209478, 58 pages, Sept. 1999.

   Solution GOT00.2 used 286 10-day cycles of Topex and Poseidon data, 
supplemented in shallow seas and in polar seas (latitudes above 66deg)
by 81 35-day cycles of ERS-1 and ERS-2 data.  The solution consists of
independent near-global estimates of 7 constituents (Q1,O1,K1,N2,M2,S2,K2,
with P1 inferred).  An a priori model was used that consisted of the
hydrodynamic model FES94.1 of Le Provost et al., and several other
local hydrodynamic models, including Mike Foreman's in the Gulf of
Alaska.  Some effort was devoted to removing the boundary problems in
FES94.1, although this was not 100% successful.  The ERS data appear most
useful in the Norwegian and Barents Seas.

   Two sets of ascii tide grids are provided.  One set is for the ocean 
tide only, another for the ocean+load tide.  The latter should be used for 
computing corrections to altimetry.  The former should be consistent with
what a conventional tide gauge measures.  (A third set providing the load
tide, defined everywhere including on land, is also available upon request.)

   There are two different software modules in this directory.  One called
PERTH2 is a subroutine to do tidal prediction given a lat/lon/time.
The other is GRIDIO which can be used to read the ascii grids.  If you
only require prediction, then you need not worry about GRIDIO.

   The prediction software PERTH2 runs on any of the provided sets of tidal
grids, depending on what kind of tide the user wants to calculate.
It returns predictions in the same units as in the amplitude grids
(generally cm, but check the header records to be sure).
   The prediction software includes 16 minor tides by inference.  These
16 tides are:  2Q1, sigma1, rho1, M1, chi1, pi1, phi1, theta1, J1, OO1, 
2N2, mu2, nu2, lambda2, L2, T2.
    Note that when running PERTH2, it expects the 8 main tide grids to be
concatenated into one file.  So before running PERTH2, do
         cat q1.d o1.d p1.d k1.d n2.d m2.d s2.d k2.d > fort.30
or the equivalent for your operating system.  If you don't understand the
time system used by PERTH2 (modified julian date), then contact me; I have
conversion subroutines.

    If you're interested in reading the actual tidal grids for some
particular reason, then use GRIDIO to read them. In any dataset, e.g. 
m2.d, the amplitude and phase grids are concatenated, so reading both 
requires simply two calls to the reader subroutine gridin.
  
  A small routine written several years ago by D Cartwright is also provided
for predicting equilibrium long-period tides.

    It should go without saying that these satellite-based data were
developed primarily for use in space geodesy.  They must NOT be used
in coastal (or other) applications risking life or property, and they
should NEVER be used for coastal navigation purposes.
