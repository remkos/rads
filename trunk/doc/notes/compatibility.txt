Compatibility issues between RADS3 and RADS4

- New RADS4 XML files
  . Need to further test converter rads_nml2xml
  . Should also include conversion of .rmf files

- Variables
  . Names of variables have changed for CF-1 compliance (already updated in RADS3 as well)
  . Some long_name's have changed to better reflect content
  . Field numbers are backward compatible

- netCDF data files
  . Variable names changed (but field numbers are still supported)
  . Global log<xx> attributes replaced by global 'history' attribute as per standard
  . Added 'original' global attribute to indicate original (GDR) file.
  . Need to update RADS3 software to make forward compatible.

- radsstat
  . Weighted rms-about-mean replaced by weighted standard deviation

- rads2asc
  . Rms-about-mean replaced by standard deviation (West 1979 method)
  . Different layout of output of rads_stat

- rads2adr / rads2xadr / rads2xgf
  . Now separate program from rads2asc
  . Fully compatible with the previous version

- rads2grd
  . Rms-about-mean replaced by standard deviation (West 1979 method)
  . Output format now determined by variables (instead of 4f9.3)

- rads2nc
  . New in RADS4

- radscolin
  . New layout of header
  . Rms-about-mean replaced by standard deviation (West 1979 method)
