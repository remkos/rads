1) Compared 2N2 determinted from GOT00.2 by admittance with 2N2 from FES2002.
Differences are marginal with up to 4 mm amplidute. Compare this to up to 2 cm
amplitude between the M2 components of GOT00.2 and FES2002.

2) Compared 2N2 determined from FES2002 N2 and M2 by admittance with 2N2 from
FES2002. Difference is exactly the same as in 1). This indicates that either
the 2N2 is ill-determined in FES2002, or that the admittance formula is not
correct.
