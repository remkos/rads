# This bash script removes from a RADS directory tree all files that
# are older than the file .bookmark at the top of that tree.
#
# This allows to purge all older files after some reprocessing. The
# file .bookmark in that case is 'touched' such that all reprocessed data
# are newer than .bookmark
#
# Forthwith it will remove any empty directories.
#
# rads_purge_older.sh -- Remove older files from RADS directory tree
# Usage: rads_purge_older.sh <directory>
